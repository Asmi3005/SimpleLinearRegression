# Horsepower Impact on Fuel Consumption - Linear Regression Project

This project explores the relationship between horsepower and fuel consumption using a simple linear regression model. The objective is to understand how an increase in horsepower affects fuel efficiency (measured as miles per gallon, MPG). The model predicts the fuel consumption based on the horsepower of the vehicle.

2. Key Concepts

- **Linear Regression**: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (fuel consumption) and one or more independent variables (horsepower).
- **Feature**: Horsepower (X)
- **Target Variable**: Fuel consumption (MPG)

3. Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- Horsepower: The engine horsepower of the vehicle.
- MPG: Miles per gallon, a measure of fuel efficiency.

4. Model Results

- **Intercept (b)**: 38.19771422
- **Coefficient for Horsepower (m)**: -0.06973593
